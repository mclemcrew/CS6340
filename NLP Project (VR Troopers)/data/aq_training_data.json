        "Sweden's Wallenberg group said it raised its holding in telecommunications maker Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson eric.St. to 37.5 of the voting rights from 28.9 pct. The move by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, one of the institutions at the core of the group of companies formed by the late industrialist Marcus Wallenberg, further consolidated group control over one of its key firms, analysts said. The foundation now controls 14.1 pct of Ericsson's voting rights with 22.3 pct held by the group's investment companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia. The move comes after the Wallenberg group fought off a hostile takeover bid earlier this month for match and packaging conglomerate Swedish Match AB smbs.St from arms and chemical concern Nobel Industrier AB by increasing its stake in Swedish Match to 85 pct from 33 pct.",

        "Allegheny Beverage Corp said it has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its foodservice unit, Service America Corp. The group includes senior management of Service America but no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said. The company has agreed to permit the group and its potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service America, it said. Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin off the foodservice subsidiary. The company said the group's review is preliminary and there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made or, if made, accepted. Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of 1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said. He declined to identify the Service America officials in the acquisition group. On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit. Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985, operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines. Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated laundry services, building maintenance services and retail office and furniture operations. In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share, excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985, Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc for 160 mln dlrs. Including discontinued operations and the special item, net income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.",

        "Fairchild Semiconductor Corp president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management buyout proposal to the company's parent at some point in the future and substantial funding is available for such a purchase. Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd . Brooks also told a press conference that if management is successful, it may later attempt to take the company public. \"I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur, and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,\" Brooks said. Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu Ltd if successful in its buyout bid. Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government officials expressed opposition to the transaction. Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout. He also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors. Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them, but he added, \"the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets.\" Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger. \"I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist,\" Brooks said. He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a link with Fairchild.",

        "MTS Acquisition Corp, a company formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each. In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended. Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and is Caesars' largest shareholder. Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc , which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel. For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a year before. For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs. MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board. MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction. It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc , has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in \"mezzanine\" financing. MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition, since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared. In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board, a request that has not yet been granted. In September 1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct. Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that \"The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past.\" Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat. \"My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice, you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration,\" he said. Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him. \"As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition,\" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck. MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.

        "Fleet Financial Group said that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company. Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split. The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding. Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's interstate banking law takes effect. For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y. holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and assets of 11.1 billion dlrs. Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline for either company's stock holders, the company said. For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68 dlrs a share. In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding. The transaction is subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval. The companies said that after the proposed merger, the combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the country.",

        "A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers. Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp , PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd and British Petroleum Co Plc . Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. \"I find (Dome's statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it,\" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers. Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at 5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.",

        "BTR Nylex Ltd said it will increase its takeover offer for Borg-Warner Corp's listed unit, Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd (BWA) to five dlrs each from four dlrs for all issued ordinary and preference shares. The new offer values the diversified auto parts manufacturer's 27.22 mln ordinary shares and 13.22 mln first participating preference shares at 202.2 mln dlrs. Formal documents will be sent to shareholders as soon as possible, it said in a brief statement. BTR Nylex, which manufactures rubber and plastic products, first bid for BWA in late January. As previously reported, Borg-Warner Corp, which owns 65 pct of BWA's ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences, advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer. This meant BTR Nylex's 50.1 pct acceptance condition could not be met, BWA said in a statement reporting its parent's decision. BWA advised shareholders to ignore the offer and said other parties had expressed interest in bidding for it. But no other bid has yet emerged. BTR Nylex is a 59.5 pct-owned listed subsidiary of Britain's BTR Plc .",

It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be eligible to vote at the meeting. Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment, based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before the end of March. Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986. Under a merger agreement entered into in November, Reuters tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45 pct of those not already owned by Reuters. As a result of the tender, Reuters now owns about 49 pct of Instinet shares. In the merger, holders of remaining Instinet shares will receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for each Instinet share. The ADS's will be valued at the average of their closing prices in the 10 trading days before the effective date of the merger. Instinet said it expects the merger to become effective as soon as possible after shareholder approval at the special meeting.",

        "Newmont Mining Corp said it completed the previously announced reduction of its share in Peabody Holding Co Inc to 49.97 pct from 61.47 pct. Newmont realized 116.8 mln dlrs in the transaction. For 1986, Newmont reported net income of 74.2 mln dlrs. Peabody, the largest coal producer in the U.S., had net income of 100.8 mln dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion dlrs in 1986. Newmont doubled its ownership in Peabody in January by purchasing 30.74 pct interest held by the Williams Cos for 320 mln dlrs. The reduction resulted from completion of an earlier announced agreement by Peabody to sell a 15.01 pct interest in the company to Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates in exchange for all the coal properties owned by Eastern.

The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce competition. Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged railroad and the public. If the commission agrees that public benefits and competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the merger case.

CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued shares, it said in a statement. The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing market level of 1.85 dlrs a share. CSR said it will announce further details of the offer soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer Sugar stock. It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already contained an element of takeover speculation. It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said. CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses. These economies can only be achieved through CSR control and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added. The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier reported statement that it will sell its Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd unit to an Exxon Corp unit for 985 mln dlrs and not proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.",

USAir spokesman David Shipley also declined comment on Piedmont Aviation Inc . USAir has offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont's stock, and 73 dlrs in its own stock for the balance. Piedmont also received an offer from Norfolk Southern Corp of 65 dlrs cash per share. Piedmont's board was meeting today, but the company declined to say what was on the agenda. A spokesman said he could not comment on the twa action. A Norfolk Southern Corp spokesman said the company had no comment on TWA's offer for USAir or on its proposal to negotiate a three-way merger between TWA, USAir and Piedmont. \"We don't have all the details,\" a Norfolk Southern spokesman said. The company's 65 dlr-a-share cash offer for Piedmont stands, he said. In its offer, TWA said as an alternative to a merger with USAir, it would be interested in discussing a three-way combination among USAir, Piedmont and TWA. It said the three-way merger would serve the best interests of the shareholders of all three companies, employees and consumers. Reuter",

        "Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June 26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie shareholders \"regarding the affairs\" of the company. Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer. Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it would be provided with \"certain information\" about Crazy Eddie, it told the SEC. Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales, proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the possible participation of Crazy Eddie management. Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future. Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and investment banker. In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility with the company, plus further declines in the price of its stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are \"continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to their investment\" in Crazy Eddie stock. Depending on its evaluation of the company, including actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open market, through private purchases or in connection with a merger or tender offer. According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93 dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.",

On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated debentures due 2007 for each GAF share. Heyman owns about 2,700,000 of GAF's 33.5 mln shares outstanding. In a letter to the committee of independent directors formed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due to rising interest rates and financial market conditions. Heyman said \"In the considerable time that has elapsed since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost unprecedented deterioration. As of the present time, the average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points.\" He said the group intends to promptly review all available options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current market conditions.",

        "Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc has joined several other foreign bidders for sequestered shares of the Philippines' largest food and beverage maker San Miguel Corp , the head of a government panel which controls the shares told Reuters. Ramon Diaz, Secretary of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), said Anheuser-Busch had told the government it was interested in buying 14 mln \"B\" shares of San Miguel. He did not disclose the offered price. Diaz said Australian brewer Alan Bond's Bond Corp Holdings Ltd had offered 150 pesos per share for the \"B\" shares. Diaz said New York investment bank Allen and Co Inc had earlier said it was interested in buying all 38.1 mln sequestered shares. He told Reuters last month Elders IXL Ltd , the Melbourne-based brewing company, had also bid for the \"B\" shares. The Hong Kong Economic Journal last month quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that Barwon Farmlands Ltd, an Australian firm owned 30 pct by Ariadne Australia Ltd, was planning a Filipino branch in order to buy the entire block of 38.1 mln shares. Anheuser-Busch last year made a 150 mln dlr bid to buy San Miguel Brewery Ltd, a Hong Kong listed company which is 69.65 pct owned by Neptunia Corp Ltd, a San Miguel Corp subsidiary. The talks broke down last June after the two sides said they could not agree on the terms of the sale. REUTER",

The company said that under the definitive agreement, Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51 pct of the new company in the open market, in private transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company. If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership within one year after the completion of the merger, the subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the company said. Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S. subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said. The transaction is subject to the approval of both company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals, and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert Halmi Jr, the company said.

        "American Motors Corp said its directors reviewed a Chrysler Corp merger proposal but took no action on it. The company said its directors met in New York today at a regularly scheduled meeting. The board's review is continuing with the company's independent legal and financial advisers, American Motors said in a statement issued from New York. American Motors' board voted to postpone its annual shareholders meeting scheduled for April 29 in Southfield, Michigan. The next regularly scheduled meeting of American Motors board will be April 29, although it is expected that directors will meet again prior to that date, according to the statement. Early last week, Chrysler said it agreed to buy the 46.1 pct interest owned by Regie Nationale des Usines Renault in American Motors and acquire the balance of American Motors in a transaction valued at 1.11 billion dlrs. Later that week, AMC said it had retained financial and legal advisers and expected to meet periodiocally over the next several weeks to consider the proposal.",

INL publishes Wellington's morning and evening newspapers as well as New Zealand provincial dailies and newspapers in Rhode Island. Just under 40 pct of INL is owned by News Ltd, an Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd . Production and administration of the two publications would be transferred to the company's existing centre in Houston. INL said the acquisition took effect on March 1. INL chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the subsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine community newspapers to 340,000 homes in the greater Houston area. Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult because the city's economy depends to a large extent on the fortunes of the petroleum industry, but the situation should improve in the medium to long term and the investment will prove to be sound, he said.",

        "General Acquisition Co said it was disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and questioned how the company might give better value to shareholders. Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it was studying financially superior alternatives. The partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss the offer with Gencorp. The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a \"superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill.\" Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make takeovers more expensive. Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended to April six from April three. It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp prior to April six. General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.

Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible. Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum. The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986. Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer. Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said. He said the company was on course for independent recovery and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987. REUTER",

        "Caesars World Inc said its board unanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best interests of its shareholders. The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's offer, made through his MTS Acquisition Corp, and not tender any of their shares. Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative transactions but did not elaborate. Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would seek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff. A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment further on its decision. On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock. Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to buyout his holdings several times during the past year. No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately available for comment. Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financially inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff. The company said other factors it considered in rejecting the offer were its financial condition, future prospects, current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which Sosnoff's bid was conditioned. Caesars' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8 point above Sosnoff's offer price.",

A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a scandal at Volkswagen AG , VW, over currency losses \"has nothing to do\" with the timing of the VEBA sale. Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair. A banker involved in the VEBA placement said \"Nothing has changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take place in the second half of March.\" This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its preparatory work, although the price had not been decided. The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.",

The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said \"He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares.\" He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile. In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts. \"A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation,\" he said. \"This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible,\" he added. The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and Malaysian breweries because \"It could only be sold as an integral unit if it was going to be sold at all,\" O'Reilly said. Reuter",

        "Vertex Industries Inc and Computer Transceiver Systems Inc jointly announced an agreement for Vertex to acquire a 60 pct interest in Computer after it completes a proposed reorganization. Computer has been in reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 since September 1986. The companies said the agreement would allow Computer's unsecured creditors and debenture holders to receive new stock in exchange for exsiting debt, and for shareholders to receive one new share of Computer's stock for each four shares previously held. The companies said the United States Bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York has given preliminary approval for the proposal, which is subject to formal approval by Computer's creditors and the court. Under the agreement, Vertex also said it would supply Computer with 250,000 dlrs of operating funds, and arrange renegotiation of its secured bank debt, among other things.",

The group added its has already had \"some contacts\" with others concerning the company, but said no understandings have been reached. \"The (Cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset value and earnings momentum,\" the Brookehill group told the SEC. The group, which currently holds 318,900 Cardis common shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York, each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners. Since April 27, members of the Brookehill group made net purchases of 6,000 Cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs a share.

        "IDC Services Inc said a new company will begin a cash tender offer by October 26 to acquire all of IDC's outstanding common for 16 dlrs a share. The company said the offer is being made under a definitive agreement reached with the new company, IDC Acquisition Corp, formed by Apollo Partners Ltd and investment clients of Equitable Capital Management Inc. The agreement calls for the acquisition of IDC for about 62.4 mln dlrs. IDC Acquisition will also tender for all of IDC's outstanding nine pct convertible subordinated debentures. IDC said the merger agreement also provides for payment of an equivalent amount in respect of employee stock options to be cancelled in the merger. As part of the transaction, the company said, it granted IDC Acquisition an option to acquire up to 20 pct of the company's outstanding shares for 16 dlrs per share. It said the planned tender offer is subject to several conditions, including the tendering of over 50 pct of the company's outstanding stock. MIM Holdings Ltd , a substantial shareholder in IDC, has agreed it will not buy any additional IDC shares until February seven and has granted IDC Acquisition a right of first refusal on any IDC shares it sells during that period, the company said. It said Apollo Partners was recently organized by three former senior Viacom Inc executives, Terrence A. Elkes, George C. Catell and Kenneth F. Gorman.",

        "Malaysia's central bank said it acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing United Asian Bank Bhd (UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to rebuild public confidence in it. UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49 mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement. But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the Indian Government. Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of 228.74 mln ringgit. It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold. The central bank early this week also announced that it had bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank, Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd, after the latter raised its capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year. Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the shares of the two banks. \"The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the stability of the these banks,\" it added. The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an ailing bank or to buy a stake in it. REUTER",

        "British Petroleum Co Plc said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted. The offer would be made through its BP North America Inc unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered. BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information. Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down 1-3/4 dlrs. BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night's close. About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's own resources. The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest. BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment. Walters added that it also felt that, due to management changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment. Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs. Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise. One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled. BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago. It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987/88 financial year, analysts said. Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets. The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently, he said. However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good. Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted. Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus. BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard, which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude oil. The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year. The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer, Spedding said. BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets. The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.",

        "Amoco Corp is apparently the successful bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a published report. The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.",

A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives. The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to 48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday. Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the transaction. Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions. The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources said. Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner, will raise its offer. That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8 in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4.",

        "Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.",

        "Merrill Lynch Canada Inc, wholly owned by Merrill Lynch and Co, is considering acquiring another Canadian securities company as the result of federal and provincial government moves to lift investment dealer ownership restrictions on June 30, according to a published report. \"We're talking to a number of people,\" Merrill Lynch Canada deputy chairman E. Duff Scott told The Toronto Star. \"Whether we're going to do something, I don't know,\" he said. A Merrill Lynch Canada spokesman declined to comment on the newspaper report when queried. Scott did not disclose which investment dealers Merrill Lynch Canada was considering acquiring, but the Toronto Star quoted unidentified industry sources as saying serious discussions have already been held with Burns Fry Ltd. Burns Fry chairman Jack Lawrence told the newspaper the investment dealer has not made a final decision, but was examining \"three or four alternatives.\" Discussions between brokers about possible mergers is to be expected pending industry deregulation, one investment industry source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. \"It's silly not to take a look (at making a merger or acquisition). If you're a businessman, you have to take a look,\" the industry source said. Under federal and provincial government regulations expected to be in place by June 30, banks, trust companies and foreign companies will be allowed to acquire existing investment dealers or establish their own securities subsidiaries.",

        "IC Industries Inc said its board approved a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of the company. To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on consumer goods and services, the company will give serious consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and defense company, if it can realize a price which will return maximum value to shareholders. In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs. IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and services field. The company said it authorized a program to repurchase between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock from time to time when conditions warrant. It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs. An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved \"across-the-board\" cuts rather than specific about targeted areas. IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp.",

        "Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its board of directors seeking to invalidate its \"poison pill\" anti-takeover plan. TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its 52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc . Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or \"poison pill.\" Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more expensive. USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont. USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no comment on TWA's lawsuit. USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending approval of a takeover. USAir said the request was \"hastily pasted together in order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large.\" USAir called on the transportation department to reject TWA's request.

        "Eastman Kodak Co said it has acquired an 18.7 pct equity interest in Enzon Inc, a pharmaceutical company specializing in protein therapy. Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity disorders, hyperuricemia and gout. The company said it acquired two mln Enzon shares for 15 mln dlrs, with loans to Enzon of two mln dlrs and interest of 30,000 dlrs credited against the purchase price. Kodak said the drugs covered by the marketing rights are in initial stages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process. It said the investment should provide the necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and provide a marketing outlet for the drugs. The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase, for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of high levels of uric acid in the body.

        "The Bank of New York Corp said it reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a Bank of New York spokesman said. \"The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,\" a Bank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6 pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one Irving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition. \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,\" said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. \"And the market is saying the deal won't go through,\" Alpert said. \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,\" another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. \"With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, a consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,\" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.",

        "Several analysts said they do not believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management group from Purolator's courier division. There had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued. Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday. Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share. analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday. Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon, Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said. Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S. courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents on the transaction to be made public later this week. Reuter",

After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a share from continuing operations. Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit. Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara, Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves would not be sold separately from the pipeline. Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for Celeron was too high, Mercer said \"There is no fire sale going on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable operation throughout the year.\" Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover bid.",

        "Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a 16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the possibility of seeking control of it. Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's managers and directors have been aimed at \"achieving an increased ownership position\" in the company. Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in a group to acquire the company. Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals. He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to any agreements or understandings. But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps regarding the future control and direction of Taft. Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to 1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6 pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs. Although he recently received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct, Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not seeking to control the company. An investor group headed by members of the wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, also holds about 24.9 pct of Taft's common stock. Reuter",

        "Dynamics Corp of America said it has reached an agreement with CTS Corp resolving all differences between the two companies. It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all of CTS. Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the company's 1987 annual meeting. Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the outstanding stock. Dynamics said the price of stock under the option, exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price for the stock for the five days ending March two. Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the additional title of President. Former President Robert D. Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek. Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven members for eight with the remaining four members of the current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new directors. Reuter",

        "Robert Fildes, president and chief executive of Cetus Corp , told Reuters that Squibb Corp is not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview. \"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,\" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co and W.R. Grace both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,\" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies.\" Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years. \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,\" said Fildes.",

        "The Ferruzzi Group's holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said. When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel. Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts.",

MacAndrews said it increased its offer to purchase all Revlon common shares to 20.10 dlrs a share, from its April 1 offer of 18.50 dlrs a share. Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews will merge into Revlon and each remaining share will be converted into the right to receive 20.10 dlrs per share in cash, the companies said. Revlon said its board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement. MacAndrews and Revlon also said they have reached a settlement with the plaintiff in the pending litigation challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews. The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights will expireon Tuesday April 28, unless extended. MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer, the companies said. Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs. On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald Perelman, offered 18.50 dlrs a share for the 63 pct of Revlon shares he did not already own. Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits were brought against Revlon alleging the original offer was too low. But, the companies said these lawsuits have been settled in the amended offer.",

        "Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover bids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed a committee of independent directors to study strategic alternatives for the 170-year-old firm. The alternatives include continuation of the company's existing business plans, possible business combinations, sales of stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the company. Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on the alternatives, Harper and Row added. Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a share for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a share from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc . After carefully considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday, the Harpers and Row board decided not to act on them. The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company's independence and take advantage of its \"considerable future prospects,\" according to director Winthrop Knowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly established independent committee. \"However, given the significant current interest in the company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available. The committee will consider all the pertinent facts and alternatives... We intend to make a careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a conclusion,\" Knowlton said. Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to recapitalize the company's stock in order to create two classes of shares with different votinmg rights.",

        "Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL) said it will offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of Monier Ltd , currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a share bid by CSR Ltd . Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement. As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday. It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base. The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid. Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31. ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances. ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment. ETL and its Feltex International Ltd associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added. Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid. He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids. As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder, Redland Plc , which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing. CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture. CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention became public last week. REUTER",

        "Dixons Group Plc said its tender offer for all of the common shares in Cyclops Corp of the U.S. Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted approximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each. This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned, Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares. The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25 dlrs each. Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not withdrawn. Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17 this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc . Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night's close of 380p. On Friday, CYACQ Corp, an investor group formed by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp , said it would increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares to 92.50 dlrs from 80.00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it with confidential information given to Dixons and if it were satisfied that any rights Dixon might have to recover fees or expenses from Dixons or to buy Cyclops stock would be rescinded or proved invalid. Audio/Video's offer is scheduled to expire March 20.",

Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the timing of any sales and the price. \"Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best opportunity,\" Prebble said. \"We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New Zealand,\" he said. \"Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that means waiting for a while, then so be it,\" Prebble said. He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it would post an excellent profit. Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability to prosper in future was hampered by its wholly-government-owned status. Prebble said access to new sources of capital would increase its ability to expand and develop. This sale announcement follows the public float in March of around 13 pct of the Bank of New Zealand Ltd. The government has said it will also float part of the capital of other state-owned operations, including DFC New Zealand Ltd, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand Ltd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.",

According to the companies, Virginia Federal has over 700 mln dlrs in assets and operates 16 branches in Virginia. Virginia Federal said the proceeds would enable it to provide increased mortgage and lending services and enable the company to compete more effectively in the Virginia market. The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year. Additionally, the companies said the converted association would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of Montrose Holding. The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to continue in office after the conversion, the companies said. Reuter",

        "Sweden's Nordbanken banking group said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by Fermenta AB's founder and former chief executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself. The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 -- was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan. The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986. Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for the shares although it expected to buy them back itself. The statement said the sale did not represent any withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main shareholders. Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln crowns until a new equity issue could be made. Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue. Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results. Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra 170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and shareholder Gotabanken and the group's new majority owner Industrivarden AB. The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the company was in a much worse state than he thought.

        "An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker International Corp based on revised terms that allow the companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as required by the U.S. Justice Department. Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger. Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month extension to complete the sale. He said there were \"several people looking\" at the domestic drilling bit business. The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects \"substantial cutbacks\" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc, the name the merged company will take. Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course. \"We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven,\" he said. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs. Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost 34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.",

        "The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies. Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common stock could be fairly valued at \"just under five dlrs a share\" given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other than Renault as a \"a good price for Chrysler. AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4. Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he regarded the proposal as a \"done deal\" because \"I can't believe anybody else would make a bid.\" \"It's a reasonable deal for both sides,\" the analyst told Reuters. \"Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC) Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around to service the products,\" Glantz said. Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting more manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada, for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.

        "Narragansett Capital Inc said it and Dudley S. Taft have requested a response from Taft Broadcasting Co by March 12. Earlier today, Taft Broadcasting said Taft, the company's vice chairman, and Narragansett had offered 145 dlrs for each of Taft's 9.2 mln outstanding shares. The company said the offer is conditioned on approval of its board, but a spokesman declined comment on whether or not the board has scheduled a meeting. The Narragansett/Taft group will provide the equity portion of the offer by contributing at least 125 mln dlrs in cash and Taft Broadcasting common, Narragansett said. It said the group has been advised by First Boston Inc's First Boston Corp that the investment banker is \"highly confident that financing for the acquisition can be consummated.\" Narragansett said the offer is subject to negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and definitive financing agreements as well as approval by regulators, Taft's board and Taft's stockholders. The Narragansett/Taft group said its letter to Taft's board states the group intends to return control over a significant portion of the company's equity to the Taft family while providing other stockholders with a means of realizing a very attractive value for their shares.

        "CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of A.C. Goode and Co told Reuters. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\" McKibbin said. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years. Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs. Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker Bain and Co Ltd said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company. \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's overall performance, analysts said. CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt, they said. \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker Meares and Philips Ltd said. Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions. Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd . \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\" Goldston-Morris said.",

        "Honeywell Inc said it has completed the sale of 57.5 pct of its Honeywell Information Systems computer business to Compagnie des Machines Bull of France and NEC Corp of Japan for 527 mln dlrs in cash. Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce short-term debt incurred last December when the company purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group. Honeywell said the sale of HIS has created a new dedicated computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell. The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is 42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by NEC, the new company said. Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine the move's pricing, Honeywell said. Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's restructuring. \"As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense, Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and financial resources on high market share business,\" Spencer said. Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S. governement. Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named Honeywell Federal Systems Inc. Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on a cost basis, recording any dividends as received. Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product line and build its business in integrated systems for networking, database management and transaction processing. The new company said its board will have nine members, including the chairman and chief executive officer. Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the new company, which began worldwide operations today, said. It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice president of Honeywell Information Systems, was named president and chief executive officer.",

Kistler said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the best interests of both companies. \"Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is good for both companies,\" Kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service company. \"We're working very hard on this merger.\" Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11 to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal.\" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was not a factor\" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies. Reuter",

        "General Partners, controlled by privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said plans to sell GenCorp Inc's aerospace and soft drink bottling divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer. General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct of the total outstanding common stock. General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio station licenses. It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co for 217 mln dlrs. But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's headquarter in Akron, Ohio. General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and related products. But it left open that it might make other changes in GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger. Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes. In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds, which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners officials said they were \"confident of our ability to promptly obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer materials.\" \"For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a prompt consummation of the transaction,\" General Partners said. Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer for GenCorp.",

        "New York investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc , who are currently seeking to acquire Burlington Industries Inc in a hostile tender offer, said they lowered their stake in the company. In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the Edelman/Dominion group, known as Samjens Acqusition Corp, said it sold options to buy 258,800 Burlington common shares, reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33 pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct. The group said the sale, which represented all the Burlington options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs. The Edelman/Dominion group last week sweetened its hostile tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after Burlington agreed to a leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76 dlrs a share. But the Edelman/Dominion group, which has litigation pending against Burlington, also said it has held talks with Morgan Stanley about \"the possibility of settlement of outstanding matters among\" it, Morgan Stanley and Burlington.
