        "Virginia Federal Savings and Loan Association said it has signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Montrose Holding Co, an affiliate of Montrose Capital Corp for 20 mln dlrs. Virginia Federal and Montrose Capital said the agreement provides for the conversion of Virginia Federal from a mutual to a stock association and the purchase of 100 pct of its stock for 20 mln dlrs by Montrose. According to the companies, Virginia Federal has over 700 mln dlrs in assets and operates 16 branches in Virginia. Virginia Federal said the proceeds would enable it to provide increased mortgage and lending services and enable the company to compete more effectively in the Virginia market. The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year. Additionally, the companies said the converted association would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of Montrose Holding. The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to continue in office after the conversion, the companies said. Reuter",

        "Sweden's Nordbanken banking group said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by Fermenta AB's founder and former chief executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself. The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 -- was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan. The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986. Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for the shares although it expected to buy them back itself. The statement said the sale did not represent any withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main shareholders. Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln crowns until a new equity issue could be made. Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue. Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results. Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra 170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and shareholder Gotabanken and the group's new majority owner Industrivarden AB. The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the company was in a much worse state than he thought.

        "An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker International Corp based on revised terms that allow the companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as required by the U.S. Justice Department. Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger. Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month extension to complete the sale. He said there were \"several people looking\" at the domestic drilling bit business. The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects \"substantial cutbacks\" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc, the name the merged company will take. Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course. \"We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven,\" he said. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs. Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost 34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.",

        "The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies. Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common stock could be fairly valued at \"just under five dlrs a share\" given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other than Renault as a \"a good price for Chrysler. AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4. Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he regarded the proposal as a \"done deal\" because \"I can't believe anybody else would make a bid.\" \"It's a reasonable deal for both sides,\" the analyst told Reuters. \"Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC) Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around to service the products,\" Glantz said. Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting more manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada, for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.

        "Narragansett Capital Inc said it and Dudley S. Taft have requested a response from Taft Broadcasting Co by March 12. Earlier today, Taft Broadcasting said Taft, the company's vice chairman, and Narragansett had offered 145 dlrs for each of Taft's 9.2 mln outstanding shares. The company said the offer is conditioned on approval of its board, but a spokesman declined comment on whether or not the board has scheduled a meeting. The Narragansett/Taft group will provide the equity portion of the offer by contributing at least 125 mln dlrs in cash and Taft Broadcasting common, Narragansett said. It said the group has been advised by First Boston Inc's First Boston Corp that the investment banker is \"highly confident that financing for the acquisition can be consummated.\" Narragansett said the offer is subject to negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and definitive financing agreements as well as approval by regulators, Taft's board and Taft's stockholders. The Narragansett/Taft group said its letter to Taft's board states the group intends to return control over a significant portion of the company's equity to the Taft family while providing other stockholders with a means of realizing a very attractive value for their shares.

Several other takeover proposals have crumbled following declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that Edelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4. Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans World Airlines Inc private and Dart Group Corp said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp . Both cited market conditions. \"Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so there's no reason for us to change,\" said Daniel Good, head of Shearson Lehman merchant banking. \"Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be in place,\" Good said. Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group.",

        "CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of A.C. Goode and Co told Reuters. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\" McKibbin said. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years. Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs. Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker Bain and Co Ltd said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company. \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's overall performance, analysts said. CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt, they said. \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker Meares and Philips Ltd said. Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions. Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd . \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\" Goldston-Morris said.",

        "Honeywell Inc said it has completed the sale of 57.5 pct of its Honeywell Information Systems computer business to Compagnie des Machines Bull of France and NEC Corp of Japan for 527 mln dlrs in cash. Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce short-term debt incurred last December when the company purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group. Honeywell said the sale of HIS has created a new dedicated computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell. The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is 42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by NEC, the new company said. Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine the move's pricing, Honeywell said. Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's restructuring. \"As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense, Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and financial resources on high market share business,\" Spencer said. Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S. governement. Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named Honeywell Federal Systems Inc. Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on a cost basis, recording any dividends as received. Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product line and build its business in integrated systems for networking, database management and transaction processing. The new company said its board will have nine members, including the chairman and chief executive officer. Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the new company, which began worldwide operations today, said. It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice president of Honeywell Information Systems, was named president and chief executive officer.",

        "Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the best interests of both companies. \"Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is good for both companies,\" Kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service company. \"We're working very hard on this merger.\" Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11 to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal.\" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was not a factor\" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies. Reuter",

        "General Partners, controlled by privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said plans to sell GenCorp Inc's aerospace and soft drink bottling divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer. General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct of the total outstanding common stock. General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio station licenses. It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co for 217 mln dlrs. But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's headquarter in Akron, Ohio. General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and related products. But it left open that it might make other changes in GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger. Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes. In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds, which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners officials said they were \"confident of our ability to promptly obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer materials.\" \"For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a prompt consummation of the transaction,\" General Partners said. Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer for GenCorp.",

        "New York investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc , who are currently seeking to acquire Burlington Industries Inc in a hostile tender offer, said they lowered their stake in the company. In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the Edelman/Dominion group, known as Samjens Acqusition Corp, said it sold options to buy 258,800 Burlington common shares, reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33 pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct. The group said the sale, which represented all the Burlington options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs. The Edelman/Dominion group last week sweetened its hostile tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after Burlington agreed to a leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76 dlrs a share. But the Edelman/Dominion group, which has litigation pending against Burlington, also said it has held talks with Morgan Stanley about \"the possibility of settlement of outstanding matters among\" it, Morgan Stanley and Burlington.
