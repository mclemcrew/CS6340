        "Taft Broadcasting Co vice chairman Dudley Taft and Narragansett Capital Inc said they intend to pursue their effort to acquire Taft Broadcasting despite the rejection yesterday of their 145 dlr per share offer by the Taft Broadcasting board. Dudley Taft and Narragansett, in a joint statement, said they intend to explore alternatives to achieve the acquisition, including further talks with Taft Broadcasting. They said they are confident that the Taft Broadcasting board will conclude that the resolution of the company's current \"unstable situation\" as quickly as possible is in the best interests of all parties. They said the Taft board did not conclude that their offer was not fair to Taft shareholders. Taft Broadcasting yesterday, however, said financial advisor Goldman, Sachs and Co found the offer to be inadequate.",

The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said \"He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares.\" He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile. In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts. \"A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation,\" he said. \"This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible,\" he added. The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and Malaysian breweries because \"It could only be sold as an integral unit if it was going to be sold at all,\" O'Reilly said. Reuter",

        "Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for about two billion dlrs in about two months. After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a share from continuing operations. Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit. Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara, Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves would not be sold separately from the pipeline. Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for Celeron was too high, Mercer said \"There is no fire sale going on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable operation throughout the year.\" Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover bid.",

        "CSR Ltd said it will offer 2.20 dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued shares, it said in a statement. The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing market level of 1.85 dlrs a share. CSR said it will announce further details of the offer soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer Sugar stock. It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already contained an element of takeover speculation. It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said. CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses. These economies can only be achieved through CSR control and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added. The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier reported statement that it will sell its Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd unit to an Exxon Corp unit for 985 mln dlrs and not proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.",

        "Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.",

        "Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL) said it will offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of Monier Ltd , currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a share bid by CSR Ltd . Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement. As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday. It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base. The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid. Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31. ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances. ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment. ETL and its Feltex International Ltd associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added. Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid. He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids. As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder, Redland Plc , which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing. CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture. CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention became public last week. REUTER",

        "Robert Fildes, president and chief executive of Cetus Corp , told Reuters that Squibb Corp is not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview. \"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,\" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co and W.R. Grace both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,\" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies.\" Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years. \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,\" said Fildes.",
