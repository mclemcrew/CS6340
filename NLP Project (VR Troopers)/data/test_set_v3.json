        "The Australian Gas Light Co (AGL) said it will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in oil and gas producer TMOC Resources Ltd in a counter-bid to the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd . The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price of 4.15. The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year, compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share. Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares. AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23. Elders Resources Ltd began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed. AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid. AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue. It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL. AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines. REUTER",

        "Malaysia's central bank said it acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing United Asian Bank Bhd (UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to rebuild public confidence in it. UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49 mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement. But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the Indian Government. Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of 228.74 mln ringgit. It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold. The central bank early this week also announced that it had bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank, Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd, after the latter raised its capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year. Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the shares of the two banks. \"The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the stability of the these banks,\" it added. The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an ailing bank or to buy a stake in it. REUTER",

Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans World Airlines Inc private and Dart Group Corp said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp . Both cited market conditions. \"Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so there's no reason for us to change,\" said Daniel Good, head of Shearson Lehman merchant banking. \"Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be in place,\" Good said.

        "Dart Group Corp said it told Supermarkets General Corp it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company. Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. \"We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms,\" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL's approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.",

        "A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.",

        "Dome Petroleum Ltd shares moved higher in the U.S. and Canada after TransCanada PipeLines Ltd made a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr bid for Dome and Dome said it is in talks with two other unidentified companies. Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders are not Canadian companies and DuPont's Conoco and Atlantic Richfield Co are mentioned as possibilities, Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said. Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange. TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at 1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as \"awfully optimistic\" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer to the shareholders. TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a subsidiary that would operate Dome assets. Current Dome shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary.",

As previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share. Under the other proposal received from Paul Bilzerian, PNP shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company said. Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.

It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be eligible to vote at the meeting. Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment, based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before the end of March. Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986. Under a merger agreement entered into in November, Reuters tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45 pct of those not already owned by Reuters. As a result of the tender, Reuters now owns about 49 pct of Instinet shares. In the merger, holders of remaining Instinet shares will receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for each Instinet share. The ADS's will be valued at the average of their closing prices in the 10 trading days before the effective date of the merger.

It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all of CTS. Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the company's 1987 annual meeting. Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the outstanding stock. Dynamics said the price of stock under the option, exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price for the stock for the five days ending March two. Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the additional title of President. Former President Robert D. Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek.

Redland already holds about 49 pct of Monier's 156.28 mln issued shares, he said in a brief notice to the Australian Stock Exchange. Locke said shareholders would be advised as soon as the discussions progressed and recommended that they keep their shares. Monier shares were trading at a 1987 high of 3.10 dlrs today, up from the previous peak of 2.80 at yesterday's close, and well above the 1987 low of 2.18 dlrs. Monier is the largest concrete roof tile manufacturer in Australia, the U.S. And New Zealand and the world's largest marketer of fly ash, according to its annual report for 1985/86 ended June 30. It recently reported first-half 1986/87 net fell to 15.02 mln dlrs from 17.09 mln a year earlier due to the Australian housing downturn, although foreign earnings rose. REUTER",

It said holders of Robert Halmi common will exchange their shares on a two-and-one-half-for-one basis for shares in the combined company. The company said the swap will be tax-free.

The company said Qintex's U.S. subsidiary also agreed to supply a minimum 70 mln dlrs line of credit to the new company, which shall be used, with Qintex approval, for financing new HRI products. The company said that under the definitive agreement, Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51 pct of the new company in the open market, in private transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company. If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership within one year after the completion of the merger, the subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the company said. Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S. subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said. The transaction is subject to the approval of both company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals, and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert Halmi Jr, the company said.

        "Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) said it bought two more community newspapers in Houston, Texas, through a subsidiary there, for an undisclosed sum. INL said in a statement Houston Community Newspapers Inc bought the South West Advocate and the South Bend Advocate, with combined circulation of 74,000 copies, and associated assets, from The Advocate Communications Corp Inc. INL publishes Wellington's morning and evening newspapers as well as New Zealand provincial dailies and newspapers in Rhode Island. Just under 40 pct of INL is owned by News Ltd, an Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd . Production and administration of the two publications would be transferred to the company's existing centre in Houston. INL said the acquisition took effect on March 1. INL chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the subsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine community newspapers to 340,000 homes in the greater Houston area. Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult because the city's economy depends to a large extent on the fortunes of the petroleum industry, but the situation should improve in the medium to long term and the investment will prove to be sound, he said.",

        "General Acquisition Co said it was disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and questioned how the company might give better value to shareholders. Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it was studying financially superior alternatives. The partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss the offer with Gencorp. The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a \"superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill.\" Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make takeovers more expensive. Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended to April six from April three. It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp prior to April six. General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements. The partnership in its statement again urged management to work with it to facilitate a transaction.",
