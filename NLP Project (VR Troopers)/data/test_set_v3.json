        "Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for about two billion dlrs in about two months. After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a share from continuing operations. Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit. Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara, Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves would not be sold separately from the pipeline. Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for Celeron was too high, Mercer said \"There is no fire sale going on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable operation throughout the year.\" Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover bid.",

        "Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA, to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery's products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply, trade sources said. In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other feedstocks.",

        "MTS Acquisition Corp, a company formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each. In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended. Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and is Caesars' largest shareholder. Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc , which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel. For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a year before. For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs. MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board. MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction. It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc , has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in \"mezzanine\" financing. MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition, since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared. In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board, a request that has not yet been granted. In September 1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct. Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that \"The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past.\" Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat. \"My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice, you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration,\" he said. Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him. \"As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition,\" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck. MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.

        "The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies. Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common stock could be fairly valued at \"just under five dlrs a share\" given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other than Renault as a \"a good price for Chrysler. AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4. Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he regarded the proposal as a \"done deal\" because \"I can't believe anybody else would make a bid.\" \"It's a reasonable deal for both sides,\" the analyst told Reuters. \"Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC) Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around to service the products,\" Glantz said. Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting more manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada, for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.

Pantera's also said it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. Pizza Inn has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to act as its financial advisor, Pantera's said. Yesterday, Pantera's stock closed at 9.50 dlrs on NASDAQ, while Pizza Inn's stock was quoted at 12 dlrs when the Amex halted trading pending the announcement of the proposed merger. From its Dallas headquarters, Pizza Inn said completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions including that the price of Pantera's stock average not less than seven dlrs during the 20 trading days before the merger. Under the agreement, Pizza Inn said it will still be permitted to complete a leveraged buyout agreement with Pizza Inn Acquiring Corp, which has been approved by its shareholders, but is subject to otaining financing.

Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it was studying financially superior alternatives. The partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss the offer with Gencorp. The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a \"superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill.\" Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make takeovers more expensive. Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended to April six from April three. It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp prior to April six. General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.

        "Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.",
