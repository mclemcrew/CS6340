        "Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a 16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the possibility of seeking control of it. Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's managers and directors have been aimed at \"achieving an increased ownership position\" in the company. Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in a group to acquire the company. Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals. He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to any agreements or understandings. But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps regarding the future control and direction of Taft. Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to 1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6 pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs. Although he recently received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct, Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not seeking to control the company. An investor group headed by members of the wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, also holds about 24.9 pct of Taft's common stock. Reuter",

        "The Philippines' Social Security System (SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer San Miguel Corp (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del Rosario said. He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share. The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and sequestered by the government. The block is split between class A and class B stock. SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N. Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres Soriano, del Rosario said. The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices. Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to unidentified foreign purchasers. He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares. President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the shares. Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on Good Government. The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.",

It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be eligible to vote at the meeting. Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment, based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before the end of March. Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986. Under a merger agreement entered into in November, Reuters tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45 pct of those not already owned by Reuters. As a result of the tender, Reuters now owns about 49 pct of Instinet shares. In the merger, holders of remaining Instinet shares will receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for each Instinet share. The ADS's will be valued at the average of their closing prices in the 10 trading days before the effective date of the merger. Instinet said it expects the merger to become effective as soon as possible after shareholder approval at the special meeting.",

        "A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.",

The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.",

        "Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc has joined several other foreign bidders for sequestered shares of the Philippines' largest food and beverage maker San Miguel Corp , the head of a government panel which controls the shares told Reuters. Ramon Diaz, Secretary of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), said Anheuser-Busch had told the government it was interested in buying 14 mln \"B\" shares of San Miguel. He did not disclose the offered price. Diaz said Australian brewer Alan Bond's Bond Corp Holdings Ltd had offered 150 pesos per share for the \"B\" shares. Diaz said New York investment bank Allen and Co Inc had earlier said it was interested in buying all 38.1 mln sequestered shares. He told Reuters last month Elders IXL Ltd , the Melbourne-based brewing company, had also bid for the \"B\" shares. The Hong Kong Economic Journal last month quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that Barwon Farmlands Ltd, an Australian firm owned 30 pct by Ariadne Australia Ltd, was planning a Filipino branch in order to buy the entire block of 38.1 mln shares. Anheuser-Busch last year made a 150 mln dlr bid to buy San Miguel Brewery Ltd, a Hong Kong listed company which is 69.65 pct owned by Neptunia Corp Ltd, a San Miguel Corp subsidiary. The talks broke down last June after the two sides said they could not agree on the terms of the sale. REUTER",

        "Robert Fildes, president and chief executive of Cetus Corp , told Reuters that Squibb Corp is not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview. \"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,\" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co and W.R. Grace both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,\" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies.\" Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years. \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,\" said Fildes.",

        "The Bank of New York Corp said it reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a Bank of New York spokesman said. \"The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,\" a Bank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6 pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one Irving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition. \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,\" said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. \"And the market is saying the deal won't go through,\" Alpert said. \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,\" another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. \"With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, a consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,\" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.",

        "The sale of the government's 25.55 pct stake in VEBA AG is still expected this month, banking sources closely linked with the transaction said. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a scandal at Volkswagen AG , VW, over currency losses \"has nothing to do\" with the timing of the VEBA sale. Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair. A banker involved in the VEBA placement said \"Nothing has changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take place in the second half of March.\" This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its preparatory work, although the price had not been decided. The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.",

        "H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly would be interested in buying Guinness PLC 's brewery division if it were for sale, a spokesman said. The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said \"He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares.\" He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile. In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts. \"A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation,\" he said. \"This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible,\" he added. The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and Malaysian breweries because \"It could only be sold as an integral unit if it was going to be sold at all,\" O'Reilly said. Reuter",
