Tested on computer lab2-11.eng.utah.edu
OS: Red Hat Enterpirse Linux 8.4

Limitations -> If the tree traversal is deeper than 4 nodes, this program will fail

Note: I added a tab character between ROOT and SOURCE but it keeps looking like a space...I'm not sure how to resolve that.
Whenever I ran with diff -w, it always worked though.
